# Nanotorch: a minimal PyTorch clone

My pet project of the moment. The goal here is to reimplement from scratch a PyTorch-like autograd library, **without relying on generative AI to produce the code** (this is a hard project constraint). I believe that while coding agents are great tools, they can also limit the learning process in such project. 

For this reason, I use Claude Code here as a "pair programming" companion: it helps me debug, reviews my code, explores the docs, but it does not take the technical decisions nor write the software. This is (for now) the best balance I found to maximize the personal benefit of these systems. 

## Nanotorch scope

- Working autograd engine.
- Tensor storage handled in contiguous memory with strided views.
- Intensive operations bound from C++ implementations.
- Partial CUDA support with acceptable performance (we don't aim for 90% of cuBLAS performance though).
- Deep learning boilerplate (modules, optimizers, dataloaders...).
- Comprehensive test coverage.

## Setup

```bash
# Install the environment
uv sync

# Launch a MLP training on mock data (but real compute)
uv run python scripts/train_mlp_basic.py --device [cpu|cuda]

# Launch the unit tests
uv run pytest 
```
